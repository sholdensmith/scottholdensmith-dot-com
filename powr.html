          Eat foods without restriction and listen to the body’s desire from a
          place of acceptance
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>We want:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Body Awareness (the need in the moment, desire, appetite)</li>
          <li>Trust</li>
          <li>Acceptance</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>We’re looking to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gain awareness</li>
          <li>Intervene early in the process</li>
          <li>Learn other ways to soothe</li>

        <p>
          Binge eating is neurologically an effective temporary strategy for the
          reduction of anxiety. It is rare for people to binge without a
          distraction, thus quieting the small voice that might hope to stop the
          behavior.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Recovery is the work of moving from safety based on conforming and
          disconnection, to safety based on turning toward ourselves.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Tenderness in recognizing our hungers, meeting them as we are able,
          fighting back when they are denied, and learning we can be safe even
          in vulnerability.

        <h2 id="Five Practices of Recovery">Five Practices of Recovery</h2>
        <ol start="1">
          <li>
            <b>Honor the impact of history:</b> You binge for good reasons, not
            for lack of willpower. The shame voice is distorted cognition and
            cultural messages. Shaming feelings makes it harder to move through.
            Feelings pass. Self-recrimination sticks. Just know: I am safe. I am
            loved.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Meet urges with POWR:</b> To move back to the window of tolerance
            where emotions are present but not overwhelming. I can rewire the
            brain.
          </li>
          <li>Escape the mythology of “thin”</li>
          <li>Take back your body as your own (BODY AS HOME)</li>
          <li>Build resiliency for long-term recovery</li>
