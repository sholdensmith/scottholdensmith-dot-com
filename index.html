        <h3>Sonnet 106 BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</h3>
        <p>
          When in the chronicle of wasted time <br />
          see descriptions of the fairest wights, <br />
          beauty making beautiful old rhyme <br />
          In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, <br />
          Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,<br />
          Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, <br />
          I see their antique pen would have express'd <br />
          Even such a beauty as you master now. <br />
          So all their praises are but prophecies <br />
          Of this our time, all you prefiguring; <br />
          And, for they look'd but with divining eyes, <br />
          They had not skill enough yourworth to sing: <br />
          For we, which now behold these present days, <br />
          Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
        </p>
