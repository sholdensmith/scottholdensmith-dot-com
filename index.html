      <h1>Chronicle of Wasted Time</h1>
      Sonnet 106 BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE
      <p>
        When in the chronicle of wasted time <br />
        see descriptions of the fairest wights, <br />
        beauty making beautiful old rhyme <br />In praise of ladies dead and
        lovely knights, <br />Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
        <br />Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, <br />I see their
        antique pen would have express'd <br />
        Even such a beauty as you master now. <br />So all their praises are but
        prophecies <br />Of this our time, all you prefiguring; <br />And, for
        they look'd but with divining eyes, <br />They had not skill enough your
        worth to sing: <br />
        For we, which now behold these present days, <br />Have eyes to wonder,
        but lack tongues to praise.

        OK, let's come back to the here and now. Start with some square
