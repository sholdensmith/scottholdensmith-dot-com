          <p>
            When in the chronicle of wasted time <br />
            see descriptions of the fairest wights, <br />
            beauty making beautiful old rhyme <br />
            In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights, <br />
            Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,<br />
            Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow, <br />
            I see their antique pen would have express'd <br />
            Even such a beauty as you master now. <br />
            So all their praises are but prophecies <br />
            Of this our time, all you prefiguring; <br />
            And, for they look'd but with divining eyes, <br />
            They had not skill enough your worth to sing: <br />
            For we, which now behold these present days, <br />
            Have eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
